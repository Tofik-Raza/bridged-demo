            "article_text": "Listen to Story\nMumbai Indians (MI) opening batter Rohit Sharma was relieved after a reluctant DRS (Decision Review System) helped him survive against Rajasthan Royals (RR) in Match 50 of the Indian Premier League 2025 (IPL 2025). The incident took place in the second over of the innings as Fazalhaq Farooqi trapped him in front of the stumps.\nThe MI opener was given out on the field, and was reluctant to go for DRS. However, he decided to get the decision reviewed by the third umpire at the very last second. Much to his good fortune, the ball pitched outside the leg stump and the decision was overturned. After the decision was overturned, Rohit was seen heaving a sigh of relief as he had a big smile on his face.\nIPL 2025: RR vs MI Updates\nRohit used his reprieve well as he went on to score his third half-century of the season. He reached the landmark in 31 balls despite a slow start. Rohit's innings came to an end on 53 (36) as he whacked nine fours in his innings. The opening batter tried to hit Riyan Parag down the ground but ended up getting caught at long off by Yashasvi Jaiswal.\nDuring his innings, he also completed 6000 runs for the Mumbai Indians. Earlier, Rohit found his form after starting the season on a disappointing note. He scored back-to-back match-winning knocks against Chennai Super Kings 76* (45) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) 70 (46), helping Mumbai extend their winning streak to five matches.- EndsPublished By:Rishabh BeniwalPublished On:May 1, 2025Also Read |Punjab Kings star Glenn Maxwell ruled out of IPL 2025 due to finger fracture"
